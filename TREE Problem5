Question is : Maximum Depth Of Binary Tree.

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

 Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2

// My Approach and CODE is :

class Solution {
public:
    
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        // if root will NULL then it will return 0.
        if(root==NULL){
            return 0;
        }
        // it visits left and right of root and do count.
        return 1+max(maxDepth(root->left),maxDepth(root->right));
    }
};
