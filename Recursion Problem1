Question is : Print N to 1 without loop.

Print numbers from N to 1 (space separated) without the help of loops.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 10
Output: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from N to 1 recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.


My Approach and CODE is :

class Solution {
  public:
    void printNos(int N) {

        // here it will check N is 10 == 0 . which is false. when 0 == 0 then it will stop.
        if(N==0)
        return;

        // After check 10 == 0 false it will print N.
        cout<<N<<" ";

        // After print N it will function call for N-1.
        printNos(N-1);
    }
};
